# wipe-out 🌊 📸

I built this iOS application in Swift and SwiftUI to make my life easier when it comes to decluttering my photos and videos.

We all have limited iCloud space so when I saw that there's only 15 GB of 200 GB left and two thirds were occupied by my photos I needed to act on it! (Assuming I didn't want to upgrade my storage plan 🙅🏻‍♀️)
The app helps swiping easily through the photos and videos last taken in Tinder style and selecting unwanted ones for deletion.

I also have too many similar photos taken within a short amount of time which I want to look through and get rid of first ideally.
This is solved in a second tab view inside the app called `Clean Up` where you get clusters of similar photos provided. 
The UI makes it easy to select the one's you want to keep and selects the rest automatically for deletion. 

Note that this project is still WIP and I have a backlog with more cool features and improvements!
